# Shuffle Move v1.0.1

This is a fork from the original Shuffle Move from Loreinator - [Original Repository Link](https://github.com/Loreinator/Shuffle-Move)

I'm not a java developer, so I used chatGPT help to convert it to a maven format (Some labels were bronken in the process).

And then added two extra functions:
* Open a Websocket Port to execute the function the function "loadAll" from external source
* Modified the Roster Menu to Always save
